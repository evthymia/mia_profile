### Introduction to Parametric Design and Grasshopper  
Parsons School of Design  
All levels, Grad Credit  
Fall  
Prereq: Permission of instructor  
Computational tools used widely in architetcure and engineering are powerful tools in the hands of any designer. This course introduces students from a wide range of backgrounds - from photography to product designers - to concepts in parametric design thinking using [Grasshopper](https://www.grasshopper3d.com/).

### Interior Parametrics  
Parsons School of Design  
Constructed Environments Department  
University undergraduate degree students with restrictions  
Fall  
Prereq: PUID 2010 Design Studio 1 or PUAD 2010 Design Studio 1 or PUPD 2010 Design Studio 1  
In this course students will study the meaning of parametric design in order to create parametric models. Parametric design supports a flexible, iterative design process that employs a system of parameters related by logic in order to generate a design. Parametric Design proposals are readily adaptable to changing design criteria and customizable to various users and environments.
