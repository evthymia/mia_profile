### Interior Parametrics

In this course, students explore design development using parametric design strategies in a series of  
individual projects focused on architectural and interior design. The course provides a comprehensive  
introduction to Grasshopper for Rhino as a tool for creating a flexible design model. Physical prototyping  
and digital analysis using plug-ins for Grasshopper allow students to engage in an iterative design process  
that seeks to produce final designs that are optimized for constructability, performance, and experience.

### Rhino I (Open Campus)

This course introduces students to 3D digital modelling techniques using Rhino. The course provides  
a comprehensive introduction to 2D digital drawing basics, 2D patterning, as well as 3D surface  
modelling and solid modelling. Students explore digital design for applications in product design and
architecture and develop a workflow for translating digital models into physical objects using laser cutting
and 3D printing.
